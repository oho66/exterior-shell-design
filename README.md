# Exterior Shell Design
This project will include: 

I. A complete CAD model of the proposed design with selected materials.

II. Complete Finite Element Analysis (FEA) results under a variety of loading conditions and panel configurations.

III. An economic analysis or Bill of Materials of the cost of the exterior shell based off the CAD model.

IV. Material specifications and key dimensions that the client can take to a manufacturer to be finalized.
